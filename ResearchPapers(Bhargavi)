    JOURNAL:
	International Journal of Engineering and Technology
    FINDINGS:
	1.The performance of channel estimation techniques for LTEdownlink receiver system based on the 10/20MHz bandwidth are
	simulated in this model2.n AWGN channel performances is better as compared
	to VA120 channel then higher order modulation energy
	consumption is less as compare in lower order modulation.
 
    PARAMETERS:
	BER,Eb/N0

    GRAPHS:
	The graph is drawn between SNR(dB) and BER.
    ADVANTAGES:

                 Abdul Hakim khlifi, Ridha Bouallegue
    JOURNAL:
	Internal Journal of computer networks and communications
    FINDINGS:
	1.In terms of MSE,
	channel estimation techniques in the two systems show same performances but only for low
	SNR values. For high SNR values, channel estimators are better for CP-LTE Downlink systems
 
    PARAMETERS:
	LTE Bandwidth, Number of used subcarriers, Number of transmit antenna, Number of Receive antenna, Modulation scheme(QPSK), Channel Model
    
    GRAPHS:
	The graph is drawn between SNR and BER

    ADVANTAGES:
	ZP-LTE has higher power efficiency when compared to CP-LTE

    LIMITATIONS:
	Simulations results show that although ZP-LTE systems outperform CP-LTE Downlink systems in terms of power efficiency, the CP-LTE systems show better performance than ZP-LTE systems and especially for high SNR values
