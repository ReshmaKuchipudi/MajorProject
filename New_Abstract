                           MIMO-OFDM Channel Estimation

A multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system combined with orthogonal frequency 
division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation can achieve reliable high data rate transmission over 
wireless channels. Channel state information for MIMO based on pilot aided arrangement is 
investigated. The performance of MIMO-OFDM is evaluated on basis of bit-error rate (BER). 
Further enhancement can be achieved through space time block coding (STBC) and orthogonal space 
time block coding (OSTBC) at transmission and receiver ends. The estimation of channel at pilot 
frequencies is conventional with MMSE estimation algorithm through MATLAB simulation. OSTBC 
shows better performance than the STBC for the MIMO-OFDM system.
